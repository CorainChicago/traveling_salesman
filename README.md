# traveling_salesman

The Traveling Salesman is a [historic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) problem and the task handed out at [ChicagoRuby Hack Night](http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRuby/events/229245222/).  

This is not a complete solution, it's an 'log n' problem and we only had the evening (after pizza).  It was fun to pair with [Uchenna F. Okoye](https://github.com/uchennafokoye).
